/**
 * <p>
 * This class calculates the distance bewteen coordinates using the Haversine formula.  Unlike
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty's_formulae">Vincenty's formulae</a>, which
 * are designed to operate on an oblate spheroid, Haversine assumes a perfectly spherical
 * Earth, meaning Haversine is less accurate than Vincenty's formulae.  Haversine was chosen for
 * its ease of implementation, plus not having to worry about a known difficulty with Vincenty, in
 * which the iterative formulae converge very slowly for some inputs.  Thus, by using Haversine,
 * we also sidestep a potential performance issue.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Earth radius used in calculations is the volumetric mean radius, not the equatorial radius.  As of
 * the date this software was written, NASA's figure for the volumetric mean radius was 6371.008 km.
